# TNF Research

**Assignment for Bioinformatics Laboratories, 1ºYear, 2ºSemester, Bachelor in Bioinformatics.**

## Summary

### Goal of the project
The aim of this project is to apply as comprehensively as possible the various bioinformatics tools presented throughout the course. 
The main idea is to select a gene (in this case, the chosen gene is TNF) and perform a characterization of the corresponding protein in evolutionary terms. 
This project intends to understand the concepts of protein homology, sequence similarity, and phylogenetic trees. Simultaneously, we aim to gain experience in using bioinformatics tools.
